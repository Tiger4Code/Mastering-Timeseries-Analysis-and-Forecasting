## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by episode number, with each folder containing a Jupyter Notebook that corresponds to the content covered in that episode. Below is an overview of the folder structure:



Mastering-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting/
```
│
├── Episode_01/
│   ├── episode_01_notebook.ipynb
│   └── additional_resources/
│
├── Episode_02/
│   ├── episode_02_notebook.ipynb
│   └── additional_resources/
│
├── Episode_03/
│   ├── episode_03_notebook.ipynb
│   └── additional_resources/
│
└── ...
```


Each folder is named according to the episode number (e.g., `Episode_01`, `Episode_02`, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find:
- **episode_X_notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook for that episode.
- **additional_resources/**: Any additional resources used or referenced in the episode, such as datasets or helper functions.
